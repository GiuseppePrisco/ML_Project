# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Course Project - Machine Learning Module

This repository contains the project developed for the Machine Learning module of the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning course. The project is based on the **Cart Pole** environment from Gymnasium.

## Environment Description

The Cart Pole environment (https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/) consists of a moving cart with a pole attached with an un-actuated joint to it. The pole is placed upright on top of the cart. The goal of the project is to keep the pendulum balanced by applying forces in the left and right directions on the cart.

## Project Details

The project involves developing a machine learning model that can successfully balance the pole on the cart. The model is trained using reinforcement learning techniques, where the agent learns to make decisions based on the state of the environment and the reward received.
